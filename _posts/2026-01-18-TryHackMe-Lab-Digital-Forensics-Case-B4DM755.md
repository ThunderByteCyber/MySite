#### **Acknowledgement of TryHackMe Lab: Digital Forensics Case B4DM755**
I would like to acknowledge the Digital Forensics Case B4DM755 lab provided by TryHackMe as the foundation for the practical components of this write-up. This interactive room simulates a realistic digital forensics investigation where the learner assumes the role of a DFIR First Responder and Forensics Lab Analyst tasked with acquiring and analysing digital evidence for use in a hypothetical court case. The lab incorporates key forensic principles — including the preservation of the chain of custody, the use of FTK Imager for forensic disk imaging, and evidence analysis — through a structured scenario involving a fictitious suspect charged with corporate espionage and theft of trade secrets. The scenarios and guided tasks within this lab have directly informed the procedures and discussions presented in this report.
