#TryHackMe Lab: Digital Forensics Case B4DM755

### Acknowledgement of TryHackMe Lab: Digital Forensics Case B4DM755
*I would like to acknowledge the Digital Forensics Case B4DM755 lab provided by TryHackMe as the foundation for the practical components of this write-up. This interactive room simulates a realistic digital forensics investigation where the learner assumes the role of a DFIR First Responder and Forensics Lab Analyst tasked with acquiring and analysing digital evidence for use in a hypothetical court case. The lab incorporates key forensic principles — including the preservation of the chain of custody, the use of FTK Imager for forensic disk imaging, and evidence analysis — through a structured scenario involving a fictitious suspect charged with corporate espionage and theft of trade secrets. The scenarios and guided tasks within this lab have directly informed the procedures and discussions presented in this report. Link: https://tryhackme.com/room/caseb4dm755*
